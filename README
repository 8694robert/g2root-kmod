Welcome to the g2root arm foreign/hostile kernel exploration toolkit.

syntax:
CROSS_COMPILE=/opt/arm-2008q3/bin/arm-none-eabi- ARCH=arm make KDIR=[KERNEL SOURCE FROM WIKI] [clean|DOSTUFF=0|DOSTUFF=1]


to build

set up your kernel like it says in the wiki under building a simple module

http://forum.xda-developers.com/wiki/index.php?title=HTC_Vision#Building_a_basic_kernel_module

then


CROSS_COMPILE=/opt/arm-2008q3/bin/arm-none-eabi- ARCH=arm make KDIR=[KERNEL SOURCE FROM WIKI] DOSTUFF=0

test and make sure it doesn't blow up and the printed (in dmesg) addresses look sane (not 0 or fffx whatever)

CROSS_COMPILE=/opt/arm-2008q3/bin/arm-none-eabi- ARCH=arm make KDIR=[KERNEL SOURCE FROM WIKI] clean

CROSS_COMPILE=/opt/arm-2008q3/bin/arm-none-eabi- ARCH=arm make KDIR=[KERNEL SOURCE FROM WIKI] DOSTUFF=1
